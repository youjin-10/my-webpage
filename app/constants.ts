      "I lived in Qingdao, China for about 5 years. I began my career as an account manager at a Korean company, handling international buyers' requests and order schedules. <br /><br />Frontend development is like the face of a website; it's the first thing users see and interact with. Similarly, as an account manager, I was the face of the company to buyers. My role required effective communication and addressing buyers' needs, just as a frontend developer must create a user-friendly interface that meets users' expectations.",

This is a screenshot of my first app. <br /><br /> Although it was a simple app that allowed users to choose numbers for RGB color and copy the value, I was thrilled to build something from scratch. I learned how to solve problems by asking for advice or searching online.",
