I began my career as an account manager at a Korean company, handling international buyers' requests and order schedules. <br /><br />Frontend development is like the face of a website; it's the first thing users see and interact with. Similarly, as an account manager, I was the face of the company to buyers. My role required effective communication and addressing buyers' needs, just as a frontend developer must create a user-friendly interface that meets users' expectations.",
